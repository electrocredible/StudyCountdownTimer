This timer was made to practice maths problems within a time limit.
There are two variables that control the time set for two buttons. The default values are 40 seconds and 65 seconds.
Two timers can be set independently.
A buzzer sets off when timer overflows.
If a button is pressed while timer is runnning, it reset the timer and count again till overflow.
